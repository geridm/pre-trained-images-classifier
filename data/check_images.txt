Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:
AlexNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg as "standard poodle, poodle".
ResNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg as "standard poodle, poodle".
VGG: Classified Dog_01.jpg as "miniature poodle". 

Differences: AlexNet and ResNet agreed on classifying Dog_01.jpg as "standard poodle, poodle", while VGG classified it as "miniature poodle". Therefore, the classifications are not the same.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
AlexNet: Classified Dog_02.jpg as "kuvasz".
ResNet: Classified Dog_02.jpg as "standard poodle, poodle".
VGG: Classified Dog_02.jpg as "miniature poodle".
Differences: None of the architectures classified Dog_02.jpg in the same way as Dog_01.jpg. AlexNet and ResNet classified Dog_02.jpg differently, and both classified Dog_01.jpg as "standard poodle, poodle". VGG also had a different classification for Dog_02.jpg.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 

Animal_Name_01.jpg (Black_bird_01.jpg):
AlexNet: Classified as "magpie".
ResNet: Classified as "magpie".
VGG: Classified as "magpie".

Object_Name_01.jpg (Soup_cup_01.jpg):
AlexNet: Classified as "mixing bowl".
ResNet: Classified as "mixing bowl".
VGG: Classified as "mixing bowl".

Correct Classifications: All architectures correctly classified Black_bird_01.jpg and Soup_cup_01.jpg as not dogs, as the classifications are accurate.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:

ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as "standard poodle, poodle" and Dog_02.jpg also as "standard poodle, poodle".
This indicates that it was consistent in its classification for both dog images, which is crucial for reliable performance in a classification task.
